# Restify
A full-stack web application for an online marketplace for short-term lodgings (like a mini AirBnB). Users can search for, book, comment on, and rate lodging experiences, as well as post and manage their own listings.

I built this with two other developers over the course of a semester-long web programming course (CSC309) at the University of Toronto (Jan-Apr 2023).

Tech stack: SQL, Django REST Framework, React, and Boostrap.
